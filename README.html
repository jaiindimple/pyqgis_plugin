## Plugin Builder Results

Congratulations! You just built a plugin for QGIS!

### What's Next
1. Test the generated sources using `make test` (or run tests from your IDE).
2. Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin directory (see Notes below).
3. Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager and enabling the provider in the Processing Options.
4. Customize it by editing the implementation file `DataExtraction_algorithm.py`.

**Notes:**
- You can use the `Makefile` to compile and deploy when you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake). The Makefile is ready to use; however, you will have to edit it to add additional Python source files, dialogs, and translations.
